    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

Effective training in Fresno, CA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I decided to move the HouseOfBurt webpage form it's original &lt;a href="http://houseofburt.wordpress.com/"&gt;Wordpress-default themed glory&lt;/a&gt; it quickly became obvious out that my HTML skills from 1997 were not going to be of much help in the Modern Web. I took the introductory course in HTML 5/Javascript from &lt;a href="http://www.codecademy.com/"&gt;Codeademy&lt;/a&gt;, but wanted to get something more in-depth. Luckily for myself I happen to live in Fresno, CA, home to &lt;a href="http://geekwiseacademy.com/"&gt;GeekWise Academy&lt;/a&gt;. The academy offers 6-week courses in several technologies - mostly ones requested by local employers. I chose the responsive web design course specifically for the CSS and HTML 5 training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The experience was a pleasant surprise, my instructor was a professional web developer, and assignments were often approached in the same manner as those in the industry. We would have a mock-up and need to reproduce it in HTML/CSS. The instructor would show us how to handle some of the more difficult parts and assist when we got stuck. All in all there was a lot of freedom in the class and we were encouraged to experiment. Offically we were taught Twitter Bootstrap and Pure CSS for our frameworks, but I was able to translate a lot of it to the Metro UI CSS that this site uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Geekwise may represent a solution to an common problem in the development field - a way to get the slices of knowledge a developer may find themselves needing while still being able to learn in an interactive environment. I hope we see more initiatives like this in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;h3&gt;Migrating from Django to Asp.Net&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to the new site!&lt;/strong&gt;
Welcome to the new version of &lt;a href="https://HouseofBurt.com"&gt;House of Burt.com!&lt;/a&gt; You'll notice a few changes - like the new Applications menu for Web Applications and the new home page. This is still the primary location to download new tools like &lt;a href="../Product/Detail/1"&gt;Service Tag Reporter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="../Product/Detail/3&gt;FileZapper&lt;/a&gt;. If you are new to &lt;a href="https:\\HouseofBurt.com"&gt;HouseOfBurt.com&lt;/a&gt; feel free to preuse my &lt;a&gt;About page&lt;/a&gt;.;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of moving to ASP.NET&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As some visitors may know I code in C#, Python, F# and Java depending on the need. The older Django based site was preforming adeguetly, but ASP.Net offered many several advatages in security and maintance that the Django version lacked or made diffcult from a maintance perspective. Some of the major benefits this change has affored me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-up"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  THere is an approximately 20% speed improvement in the ASP.Net code over the DJango code. This mostly noticable in the performance on the more calculation heavy portions like the dynamic sidebar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-up"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Code First Data Migration has allowed me to keep the schema up to date between my local and hosted SQL database without the headaches of trying to version a SQLLite flat file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-up"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Better Resource handling. Django does a decent job (especially after 1.6) of allowing the developer to automaticcly minify files and host static files. Django did a decent job, but the amount of setup and configuration needed to get a hosted and local site preforming with the same code is pretty arcane comapred to most web frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The drawbacks&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is a great language for programmers there's a reason that Django's such a popular choice for web applications. Not everything is an improvement after the switch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-up"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Controller-View interaction. Django has a natrual advantage here as python is a dynamic language and already comfortable with the idea of passing in objects it doesn't nesscailry know the property of. By comparision, the ASP.Net ViewBag object feels like an explosion waiting to happen as it starts as a dynamic object but occasional takes on proeprties more akin to Static Typing due to C# natual contraints.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-up"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  More Infrastructure: While Django may not be much of a speedster in the data-crunching department, it really gives teh developer the ability to get running with a minimum of instructure. Most changes server-wise are just setting a pair of configuration files whereas ASP.Net was built with much more control but much more configuration needed in various places. The fact that there are two web.config files in MVC5 that have nothing to do with each other is terrible. Why isn't the View based one name view.config?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-up"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Structure: One thing you have to give Django props for is that they understand the idea of seperating out how different sections of the website needs to work. Each 'application' has its own controller, views, and model and they are all contained within their own folder. Asp, by constrast, seperates the components by their type, so that controllers are all lumped together, along with the Views. In order to find all the Aspects on a web application I may be navigating between 4 sepearate folders in the source code. Not cool ASP, not cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the End, I feel that the ASP implmentation is performing much better than the Django implmentation. While this is largely due to their server implmentations, the change has taught me a lot about how Web Frameworks can differ wildly from each other in key areas. I'm wondering if anyone else has made the transition from ASP to Django (or vice versa) and how they feel the two frameworks compare.

  <data name="Article12Content" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Today is the official launch of &lt;a href="http://www.contextisneeded.com"&gt;ContextIsNeeded.com&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first web application developed under the House Of Burt name and available for the public. I created it as a very basic example of how a web application can work and to point out the hilarity of certain StackExchange questions were placed out of context.; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did the project come about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Like most developers, I am an avid fan of the &lt;a href="http://stackexchange.com"&gt;StackExchange Network&lt;/a&gt;. The network is a collection of sites that are each dedicated to a certain subject or community (such as &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/"&gt;programming&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://workplace.stackexchange.com/"&gt;workplace ethics&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://judaism.stackexchange.com/"&gt;Judaism&lt;/a&gt;). Sites in the StackExchange network have a neat feature: &lt;a href="http://stackexchange.com/questions?tab=hot"&gt;Hot Questions List&lt;/a&gt;. This is a simple list of questions from other sites that are popular with currently browsing users. It's not uncommon to see a question on there that sometimes makes you stop and wonder just what in the world is being asked.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;img src="../Content/img/StackExchange_HotQuestions.jpg" alt="example of Hot Network Questions bar"  /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I've been boggled by this out-of-context question titles often enough that I started collecting them for coworker's amusement. The idea of pairing them with also out-of-context stockart came up after running into this question: &lt;a href="http://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/44574/how-to-create-and-run-a-realistic-cult"&gt;How to create and run a realistic cult?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;. I filed the idea away in my 'potential application to write' list and let it lie at first. When I decided to start writing web applications it was a natural to pick as it had low complexity and looked good as a single page web application.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does it work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The web application has three components: The stockart photo, the quote (in a caption bubble), and the application menu. When the page loads the html, it makes a call against a REST Api and receives a photo url, a set of caption coordinates and a stackoverflow question to place inside the caption. Each component had different needs, but needed to be able to handle each of them in a lightweight manner as possible. People aren't going to expect much of a page load from a site with such little complexity.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The stock photo is picked randomly by the REST api each time the api is called. It can be one of any 5 images of people 'wondering something'. The photos were originally set via pure CSS (with only the URL changing), but chrome doesn't treat the background image css the same way between it's desktop and tablet(android) versions, causing the tablet version to display the image too high and running off the top of the page. I decided to leverage a small but useful library called Backstretch &lt;a href="http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/"&gt; available here:&lt;/a&gt;. The plugin figures out the proper viewport size and scales the image to match as a background div. This works beautifully even when resizing the browser window. The solution does end up leveraging Jquery, but I was already doing so for the REST calls and initial page load so it wasn't a noticeable cost to add the library on top of that.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The quote caption is the heart of the application and is also supplied by the Rest api call. The caption bubble is moved according to the background image involved. In the backend, the question is picked at random from a SQL table hosted in a Windows Azure Sql instance.  All this is queried using JQuery's  $.Ajax operator. The biggest part was figuring out  where to put each div in relation to the clipart that fit best with the varied screen sizes. I'm still tempted to go back and make some kind of adjustment for mobile screens.&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Api calls are also used for the submission endpoint, which allows me to leverage SendGrid and have users of the site submit their own questions for review. Floating divs are summoned for the about and submit dialogs, which can be closed by either clicking again on the menu item or on the top bar a-la-windows or macintosh. The divs use Bootstrap panels, which are surprisingly difficult to get working within Bootstrap's famous column system. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I feel like this project met its goals but also challenged me greatly in an unexpected direction - visual design. As a developer I find it very easy to write code, but figuring out the best way to convey information to a user is a very complex beast that can't be learned overnight. I've started reading &lt;I&gt;Design for Hackers&lt;/i&gt; by &lt;a href="http://designforhackers.com/"&gt;David Kadavy&lt;/a&gt; ( a note on his site: scroll down to find the content, its not just the email signup). Hopefully this will help me address issue such as the pop-up menu - I'm still not happy with it.

    <value>&lt;p&gt;I recently gave a talk at the Central California .Net User Group about &lt;a href="http://monogame.net/"&gt;Monogame&lt;/a&gt;. It was my first major speaking engagement since becoming a professional developer and I was glad to share about a technology I've enjoyed using. For those who may be unfamiliar with the technology, Monogame is an Open Source implementation of Microsoft's XNA framework. XNA was built initially with the goal of making it easy to build games for Microsoft devices like the XBox or Windows Phone, but Monogame has expanded this selection to a huge array of devices and operating systems, from the Nintendo Wii to the venerable Linux operating system.&lt;br&gt;
Getting started in Monogame can be pretty daunting - there's a lot of new concepts to learn and API calls to learn. This is doubly true for anyone who comes from a traditional application development bacckground. I wanted to offer three pieces of advice for anyone starting out with Monogame: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1) Learn the high-level architecture&lt;/strong&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The hardest part of learning Monogame is understanding how the architecture functions. Most tutorials and books feed you the individual bits piecemeal and its not always clear how they all work together. This is especially important because the model is so different from typical application development. In application development you usually have  a User Interface (views) that talks to controllers which in turn talk to your model(usually a database or some for of information storage). This is a pretty linear pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/static/media/mvc.png" width=25% /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this is a pretty high-level view of most Monogame projects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/static/media/MonogameHier.png" width=25% /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see your things are much more 'flat' in a typical Monogame. Your game object communicates with your Objects(Model) controller, your Gamestate controller, and your Input/Output controllers. This items aren't hierarchal like they are in a typical MVC application, and it's not unusual for the Gamestates to communicate directly with the input controllers or vice-versa. Still, taking some time to ask yourself which of the three tiers your next class is going to fit in will help you understand just why class X is calling Y instead of class Z.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2) Run through a good tutorial or book &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned XNA mostly through bits and pieces - modifying other people's code, researching  how to do things and googling when all else failed. These are valuable learning tools but it meant I often was creating coding messes in which I couldn't have told what was happening. Monogame uses a very large amount of built-in objects and classes to take a lot of the hard work away from you but it is still important to learn what these objects and classes do. My first recommendation is going through the XNA RPG tutorial here: &lt;a href="http://xnagpa.net/xna4rpg.php"&gt;http://xnagpa.net/xna4rpg.php&lt;/a&gt;. The tutorial are free, and although they are made for XNA, I was able to re-follow them in Monogame when I switched over without trouble as the code is the same. For those who want to take the book approach, there is the &lt;a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0790145310187.do"&gt;Microsoft XNA book&lt;/a&gt; designed to give you the basics, and at least two books now on market that use Monogame directly (&lt;a href="http://www.apress.com/9781430258360"&gt;Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 Game Development&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1466501898/"&gt;2D Graphics Programming for Games&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;strong&gt;3) Keep a finished project handy for reference&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the final download of the &lt;a href="http://xnagpa.net/xna4/downloads/EyesOfTheDragon31.zip"&gt;XNARPG series&lt;/a&gt;, there is also the &lt;a href="http://monogame.codeplex.com/"&gt;starter kits&lt;/a&gt; that give a good example of what a completed Monogame project can look like. I have found these invaluable when I desperately trying to figure out how best to approach an issue that's been handled by every game out there like Menus, Network code, and handling pixel effects. Having a completed project open does come with one caveat: Never, never let yourself copy and paste code from the completed project. This always ends with some piece of code that was never really meant to be in your project being shoehorned in. Instead allow yourself to transcribe the relevant bit of code, inserting your own variable and references. You will thank you self later.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About Service Tag Reporter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service Tag reporter is a software based utility that fetches warranty information from Dell&amp;#8217;s Warranty tracking servers.&lt;br /&gt;Enter in the desired service tags into the left hand input window and click &amp;#8216;Query Tags&amp;#8217; to get a list of products and their &lt;br /&gt;associated warranties. If you need to find out the service tag of a remote workstation in your network enter the machine name or IP address next to the &amp;#8216;Find Tag&amp;#8217; button. Click on the button and the service tag will be added to the input box.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deal O Round&lt;/strong&gt; is a single player card game featuring poker combinations on a 5x5 grid. Find poker combinations on the table and gain points! Larger points amounts are awarded for longer and more diffcult combinations.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have two minutes to create poker hands. The countdown timer is located on the top left side of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poker hands are created by pressing your finger on a card and dragging up, down, left or right. Diagonal selection is only allowed on the first level. As you drag the cards will dim indicating that they have been selected. Releasing your finger causes the game to evaluate the hand. Be sure to release while selecting your last card or the selection will not be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If no valid selection was made, the cards will remain. If a valid hand is made the cards are discarded and points are given. The remaining cards fall down to fill the empty positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valid hands include all normal poker hands added with three and four card versions of a flush or straight.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
